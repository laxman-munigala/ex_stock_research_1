      "1. **Key Valuation Metrics Context**: No direct data on P/E, P/S, D/E; infer from context—strong balance sheet (current ratio ~0.9 but covered by cash flow), massive $110B buyback signals mgmt views stock undervalued vs. growth outlook. Relative to peers/historical: premium but justified by services shift and margins.\n",
      "2. **Recent Financial Performance Context**: Revenue/net income accelerating—Q3'25 +10% rev YoY record, iPhone +13%, services records; prior quarters low-single digit growth. Drivers: iPhone resilience (offset China dip), services +12%, subscriptions >1B.\n",
      "3. **Profitability Context**: Margins improving/stable (gross 46-47% guidance, up sequentially; op margins to 32-37% thru 2032 per est). ROE strong implied by EPS growth; superior to peers via services recurring revenue.\n",
      "4. **Analyst Outlook**: Moderate Buy (21 buys), 7.3% upside to ~$252 avg target (range varies); watching iPhone launches, services monetization, China recovery, tariffs. EPS/rev growth 10%+ next 1-2yrs.\n",

      "6. **Growth Prospects and Future Outlook**: Accelerating via iPhone double-digit (Q1'26), services double-digit, China rebound; risks: China sales, tariffs ($1.1B reserve). Long-term: 6-10% rev growth, AI/services key.\n",
